      Differentially expressed genes using the model computed with sleuth by taking only a manually configured representative transcript for each gene.
      The columns `b_*` and `b_*_se` display the effect size β and the corresponding standard error for every covariate in the model. They are analog to log2 fold changes. Note that non-binary covariates are binarized by sleuth, leading to multiple columns `b_*1`, `b_*2`, etc.
      In addition, a signed version of the pi-value score (as proposed by `Xiao et al. 2014 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/`) is shown. The sign reflects the sign of the effect (i.e. positive for upregulation, negative for downregulation).
