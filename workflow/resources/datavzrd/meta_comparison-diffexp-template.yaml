    desc: |
      The axes represent the log2-fold changes (beta-scores) for the two models, with each point representing a gene. Points on the diagonal indicate no difference between the comparisons, while deviations from the diagonal suggest differences in gene expression fold changes between the treatments.
      Dealing with the plots: You can drag the plot to centre interesting areas. You can zoom into the plot using the mouse wheel. When you click on a gene, it is also highlighted in the other plot. If the ‘Shift’ key is held down, several genes can be selected at the same time.
