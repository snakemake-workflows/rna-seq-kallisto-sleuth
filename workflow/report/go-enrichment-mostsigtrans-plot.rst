**Network plot of enriched gene ontology (GO) terms** with enrichment determined and plot created by goatool. The most significant transcript of each gene was determined by sleuth using the model ``{{ snakemake.params.model["full"] }}``. GO term node fill colors are as follows, with p-values adjusted using FDR control with the Benjamini-Hochberg method: light red < 0.005; light orange < 0.01; yellow < 0.05; grey > 0.05.
