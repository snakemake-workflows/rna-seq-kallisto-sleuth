Genes exhibiting differential isoform usage/splicing in model {{ snakemake.wildcards.model }}. 
The column switchConsequencesGene denotes whether the isoform switch has potential functional consequences (e.g. on protein domains).
See `Differential splicing plots (without consequences)`_ and `Differential splicing plots (with consequences)`_ for details about each gene occurring in this table.
