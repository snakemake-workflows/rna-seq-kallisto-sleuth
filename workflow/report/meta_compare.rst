Meta comparisons for {{ snakemake.wildcards.meta_comp }}. 
The axes represent the log2-fold changes (beta-scores) for the two models, with each point representing a gene. 
Points on the diagonal indicate no difference between the comparisons, while deviations from the diagonal suggest differences in gene expression between the treatments.
The color encodes the corresponding q-value.
By clicking on points, their label can be displayed.
Holding the Shift key allows to select or deselect labels for multiple genes.
