Meta comparisons for {{ snakemake.wildcards.meta_comp }}. The axes represent the log2-fold changes (beta-scores) for the two models, with each point representing a gene. Points on the diagonal indicate no difference between the comparisons, while deviations from the diagonal suggest differences in gene expression between the treatments.
