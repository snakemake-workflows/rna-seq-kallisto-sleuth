params:
  # for kallisto parameters, see the kallisto manual:
  # https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/manual
  # reasoning behind parameters:
  # * `-b 100`: Doing 100 bootstrap samples was used by the tool authors
  #   [when originally introducing the feature](https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto/issues/11#issuecomment-74346385).
  #   If you want to decrease this for larger datasets, there paper and
  #   [a reply on GitHub suggest a value of `-b 30`](https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto/issues/353#issuecomment-1215742328).
  kallisto: "-b 30"

  # these cutadapt parameters need to contain the required flag(s) for
  # the type of adapter(s) to trim, i.e.:
  # * https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#adapter-types
  #   * `-a` for 3' adapter in the forward reads
  #   * `-g` for 5' adapter in the forward reads
  #   * `-b` for adapters anywhere in the forward reads
  # also, separate capitalised letter flags are required for adapters in
  # the reverse reads of paired end sequencing
  # 
  # reasoning behind parameters:
  # * https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#trimming-paired-end-reads
  # * `--minimum-length 33`:
  #   * kallisto needs non-empty reads in current versions (fixed for future releases:
  #     https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto/commit/64fe837ca86f3664496483bcd2787c9376584fed)
  #   * kallisto default k-mer length is 31 and 33 should give at least 3 k-mers for a read
  # * `-e 0.005`: the default cutadapt maximum error rate of `0.2` is far too high, for Illumina
  #   data the error rate is more in the range of `0.005` and setting it accordingly should avoid
  #   false positive adapter matches
  # * `--minimum-overlap 7`: the cutadapt default minimum overlap of `5` did trimming on the level
  #   of expected adapter matches by chance

    adapters: "-a ACGGATCGATCGATCGATCGAT -g GGATCGATCGATCGATCGAT "
